# Extra_Curriculum_Activity
This repo is my project of Extra Curriculum Activity.
Their is no such platform where the kids, who are excellent in extra curricular activities, can be seen by school/college level just by browsing school/college name.

This is a time of generation where not only academics seen by the everyone because Skills matters. 

If parents wants to polish their interest so that they can think to make a career in it. So, how can they analyse that whatever the school will be able to do it or not, without visiting each school.
